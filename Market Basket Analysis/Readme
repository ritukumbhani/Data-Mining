Market basket analysis is a widely used data
mining technique to identify patterns of co-occurrence among
products that customers frequently purchase together. The Apriori
algorithm is a popular method for performing market basket
analysis, which works by iteratively generating frequent itemsets
and association rules. In this project, we have done market basket
analysis with the Apriori algorithm, including its key concepts,
methodologies, and practical applications. We discuss how the
algorithm can be used to identify relevant product combinations
and optimize product placement and promotion strategies.
Additionally, we highlight the challenges and limitations of
Apriori algorithm and offer insights into its future directions.
Overall, this paper explains the purpose behind the market basket
analysis and the Apriori algorithm as a valuable tool for improving
business decision-making in the retail industry.
